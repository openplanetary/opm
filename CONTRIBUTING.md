# How can you contribute to OpenPlanetaryMap (OPM) ?

_Hey! you've made it to this page... Nice, maybe you can help. :)_

## Give your feedback to our new Mars basemap

We recently made public a first draft version of our OPM vector-based basemap of Mars ([OPM Mars Basemap v0.1](https://github.com/openplanetary/opm/wiki/OPM-Mars-Basemap-v0.1)).
Please raise any [issues](https://github.com/openplanetary/opm/issues) (suggestions, feedback, ideas...) related to the design and/or usability of this basemap.

![Issue example](https://github.com/openplanetary/opm/blob/gh-pages/docs/issue-example.png)

If you like the OpenPlanetaryMap project we can follow us on Twitter [@opmteam](https://twitter.com/opmteam).
You can tweet your home-browed maps using our OPM basemap with the `#OpenPlanetaryMap` hashtag.

_Thanks!_
